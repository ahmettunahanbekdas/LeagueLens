# LeagueLensApp
 
This app is a video game discovery and search app. With this app you can discover games, search for them, see their details and save your favorite games to your favorites list. I tried to write clean code using protocols. I paid attention for retain cycle and memory management. I prevented crashing app by warning the user when there were connection problems. You can see the details, video and screenshots below.

## :nut_and_bolt:Â Key Features

**Architecture:** MVVM 
MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) is an architectural design pattern in software development, dividing applications into three key components:

- **Model:** Manages data and business logic, handling data retrieval and storage.
- **View:** Represents the user interface, responsible for displaying data and updating based on changes observed in the ViewModel.
- **ViewModel:** Serves as an intermediary, processing data from the Model for presentation in the View. It contains application logic, handling user inputs and interactions.


**UI:** Programmatic UI, No storyboard

**Networking:** URLSession

**Database:** CoreData
